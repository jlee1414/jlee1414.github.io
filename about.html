        I was born in 1985 in Winchester Hospital outside of Boston, Massachusetts. Shortly thereafter, at only two months old, my parents moved us to Washington state where I have continued to reside. 
        I am a first generation Korean American and can speak Korean and English fluently. I am currently a student at Ada Developer's Academy and will graduate in January of 2023.  
        I have an intense love for dogs and my dream is to foster and rescue in the future. I have one dog named Emma who is 14 years old and is an English Springer Spaniel.  
        I also love and collect diamonds dabble in some jewelry design.
