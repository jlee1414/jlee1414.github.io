        <h1>HOBBIES</h1>
        <p>I started my love for diamonds about fifteen years ago. I was looking for a diamond for an engagment ring and I fell deep into the rabbit hole of scintillation, faceting, and optimum light return.
        My true love is with antique diamonds. They hold such character and history. They were cut by hand in candlelight and so perform at its highest peak in the low lights of a candle. This was before the
        invention of computers so these diamonds were cut by master cutters that had perfected their craft. The are about three well known antique cuts. First is an Old European cut which is the predecessor of what
        we know as the modern round brilliant. Next is an Old Mine cut which is the predecessor of the cushion. The antique emerald which is now known as the modern emerald. These cuts all have a common attribute 
        and it is called a culet. All modern cuts have a pointed culet. Antique cuts have a culet that has been cut so that there is no point. The result is an affect called kozibe. I encourage you to explore the many
        wonderful characteristics of diamonds and please <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me about any questions you have about diamonds.
